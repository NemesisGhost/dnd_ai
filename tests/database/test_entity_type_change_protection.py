"""Parent-side entity-type-change protection (revision 048).

core.enforce_entity_subtype() (revision 004) validates from the subtype
side: an INSERT or UPDATE on e.g. world.dungeons checks the owning entity's
type. These tests cover the reverse direction — UPDATE core.entities SET
entity_type_id — which revision 048 closes with two triggers: a generic one
driven by core.entity_types metadata, and a dungeon-specific one for the
"child areas stranded even after the marker row is deleted" case the generic
trigger alone cannot see.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Concurrency safety of the parent-side/subtype-side checks (revisions 053, 056)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Two real connections. Earlier versions of these tests proved blocking by
# setting a short lock_timeout on the second statement, letting it fail, and
# retrying in a fresh third connection — useful lock-attachment evidence, but
# not proof that the *original* waiting statement itself ever resumes and
# revalidates against the newly committed state. A post-merge review
# (PHASE5_REMAINING_ISSUES.md) required the stronger standard, which every
# test below now meets: keep the second statement genuinely alive on its own
# thread while the first transaction commits, confirm via pg_stat_activity
# that it was truly waiting on a lock (not merely slow), join the thread and
# assert on its actual resumed outcome, and then — on a third, independent
# connection — query the committed database state directly to prove no
# invalid combination survived, regardless of which side won. This reuses
# the pattern already established in
# test_world_ruleset_dependency_and_concurrency.py::_assert_blocked_delete_resumes_and_is_rejected
# (redistributed there from the former test_phase4_remaining_issues.py
# monolith — see DEVELOPMENT.md §2.1) for a FOR SHARE row lock, generalized
# here to pg_advisory_xact_lock.

"""Parent-side entity-type-change protection (revision 048).

core.enforce_entity_subtype() (revision 004) validates from the subtype
side: an INSERT or UPDATE on e.g. world.dungeons checks the owning entity's
type. These tests cover the reverse direction — UPDATE core.entities SET
entity_type_id — which revision 048 closes with two triggers: a generic one
driven by core.entity_types metadata, and a dungeon-specific one for the
"child areas stranded even after the marker row is deleted" case the generic
trigger alone cannot see.
